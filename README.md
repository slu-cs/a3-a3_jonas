Does the page allow a poll to be created with one question and multiple answers?
  - Yes.

After the poll has been created, does the page allow votes to be cast?
  - Yes.

After votes have been cast, does the page allow them to be tallied?
  - Yes.

Is the user interface intuitive and easy to use?
  - We'd be less likely to hit the "Create Poll" button too soon if it were at the bottom.
  - Having the older sections around when they're no longer needed could be confusing.
  - It would be nice if the winning result were highlighted in some way.

Is the page tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
  - Yes.
